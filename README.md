# Vigenere_Encryption
This is a python program that provides basic functionality of encrypting messages beyond the Caesar cipher. It uses a method that takes a private key that is shared between correspondents, and takes the intended message, and converts all of the letters into numbers, and going along each character, adds to it the value of the corresponding character in the private key. 

Please don't use this for serious encryption purposes, as it is easily cracked by modern computers and programs.
